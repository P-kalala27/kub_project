TITLE: Simple Todo App with DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx)
--------------------------------------------------------------

    Description:

This repository implements a straightforward todo application leveraging modern DevOps practices:

  *  Frontend: Built with React for a performant and user-friendly experience.
  *  Backend: Developed using Node.js for a robust and scalable API layer.
  *  Database: Employs a suitable database solution MongoDB for storing
               and managing todo data .
  *  Docker: Containerizes the application components (frontend and backend)
            for consistent and isolated environments.
  *  Kubernetes: Orchestrates the deployment and management of the
                containerized application across your infrastructure.
  *  Nginx: Acts as a reverse proxy, providing a single entry point and
             load balancing for incoming requests.

            Getting Started (Prerequisites):
            ---------------------------------

1. Docker: Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your system.
          Refer to the official Docker documentation for installation instructions: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ Â  
2. Docker Hub Account (Optional): If you plan to push your Docker images to a 
            public registry like Docker Hub, create an account at https://hub.docker.com/
3. Kubernetes: Have a running Kubernetes cluster available. Installation 
            and configuration instructions vary depending on your environment. Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/


        Running the Application:
        ------------------------

  1.  Clone the Repository
  2. Build and Push Docker Images
  3. Deploy to Kubernetes
  4. Access the Application:
        The application will be accessible through a Kubernetes Service (details provided in deployment.yaml). You may need to obtain the external IP address or configure an Ingress if using a cloud provider or external load balancer.
   5. Environment Variables (Optional):
        Create a .env file in the project root directory to store sensitive information like database connection details.
        Reference these variables in your backend code using a suitable library (e.g., dotenv).
